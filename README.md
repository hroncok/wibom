Application called Wine bottle management (or wibom) is used to (as its name suggests) manage so-called Wine bottles.

[Wine](http://www.winehq.org/) is the program for running applications for Microsoft Windows on other operating systems, primary on GNU/Linux. This program creates in the user’s home directory a folder called .wine containing user preferences, the simplified version of Windows registers and files structure of simulated disk C:. Many Wine users don’t know there can be more those folders coexisting. They are called bottles. Because of bottles it is possible to have a few isolated instances of “Pseudowindows” on one system.

Wine offers no system for managing those folders. It is needed to have a basic knowledge of using Bash or any other system shell and knowledge of principles of Wine’s job to be able to use bottles. And this is business of wibom.

Wine bottles can be easily managed, they could be created, cloned. Windows software can be easily installed into them. Everything is possible through easy GTK interface.
